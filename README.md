  throughout the year.

- Implement more sales incentives nationwide to boost overall sales performance.
- Reduce stock levels for underperforming products to free up capital for higher-demand items, ensuring healthier cash flow.
- Prioritize stocking top-performing categories, as they have consistently driven sales and possibly revenue.
- Introduce loyalty programs or exclusive incentives to reward top customers to encourage repeat purchases.
- Conduct further research to understand why certain low-performing products are not being purchased and address these barriers.
- Study the reasons behind the low patronage outside the South and Midwest regions to improve performance in other areas.
