## Project Overview
This project analyzes FutureTale Hotel bookings using Excel to address the rising issue of reservation cancellations. The data revealed a 22% increase in 
cancellations between July 2017 and October 2018, highlighting a significant shift in booking patterns. By leveraging Excel, key factors contributing to this 
trend were identified, offering insights to mitigate future cancellations and improve reservation stability.

## Problem Statement

![](hotel1.jpg)
- High number of cancellations and no-shows as a result of Current cancellation policy that allows free or low-cost cancellations.
- This policy benefits guests but negatively impacts the hotelâ€™s revenue.

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of hotel reservation data to uncover insights and address the challenges associated 
with rising cancellation rates.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was provided by 10Alytics. The key features are Booking ID, number of adults and children, number of weekend and weeknights, 
meal plan type, car parking requirements, reserved room type, lead time, arrival year and month, market segment, repeated guest status, previous cancellations and bookings, 
booking status, and average price per room.

## Data Handling
Data compilation and cleansing were performed, with duplicate entries identified and removed. A new column, "sum of is_cancelled," was introduced using the 
"IF" function to assign a value of "1" for cancelled bookings and "0" for non-cancelled ones. The VLOOKUP function was applied to derive accurate arrival month names by referencing 
the table containing month numbers and paired them with their corresponding names, ensuring accurate reservation details for FutureTale Hotel.
